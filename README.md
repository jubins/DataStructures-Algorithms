## Contributing
Thank you for interest in contributing! Please follow below guidelines:
- First fork the repository and then clone it.
- After that create a branch for your changes. For example:
  - `<your_name_or_initials>-<problem>-<language>` like `jubin-two-sum-python`.
- You may contribute by:
  - Implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under right section. Make a new section for it if it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.
  - Optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
  - Adding a different solution for the problem.
  - Finding and fixing bugs.
  - Adding commends and examples to explain the algorithms better.
  - Adding test cases.
  - Improving documentation.
